Reproduce the steps from lecture (ensure you can access both the Twitter and Basilica APIs via Python), then:

    Write methods to pull actual Users and Tweets and replace your invented data with actual Twitter data
    Add an embedding field to your Tweet model, and functions to populate it with embeddings returned from Basilica
